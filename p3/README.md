### Broker ~ Processing of sequences

In this task we will deal with the problem of processing sequential data. We Will obtain the historical data of stock exchange of different companies and we will analyse the value of his actions along the time. We Will define an algorithm that will allow us detect changes of behaviour, and finally, will define a *estratégia of purchase/fans of actions to the detect changes of behaviour of the data.
The work consists of three exercises.
1. Implement an algorithm for sliding window (SLIDEWIN).
2. Implement an algorithm for adaptative window (ADWIN).
3. Define an strategy for purchase/sale actions in order to obtain profits.

### ADWIN

ADWIN is an adaptive sliding window algorithm for detecting change and keeping updated statistics from a data stream, and use it as a black-box in place or counters in learning and mining algorithms initially not designed for drifting data.
